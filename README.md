# One Click Store Backend
Nowadays getting good quality used items at a fair price is becoming hectic, and even very difficult to
get some items like used vehicles even in national Auction centres. On the other hand is how some of these goods can be able to reach their intended new owners in time and in good quality.

The application will bridge the gap and ensure availability of the products to the intended recipients
in time.
It will also create an avenue for users to also sell their items which they no longer need through
the website.
